title: Reset Details Summary Marker
---

A [preflight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight) that removes the arrow from the `summary` tag when it's placed inside a `details` tag.

```css
/* NOTE: for some reason `@base` didn't work here. */
@layer base {
    details > summary {
        list-style: none;
    }

    details > summary::marker, /* Latest Chrome, Edge, Firefox */ 
    details > summary::-webkit-details-marker /* Safari */ {
        display: none;
    }
}
```
